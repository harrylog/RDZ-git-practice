practice git collaboration


i want you to practice basic self commands like 
git add pull push commit branch log  
+
the above with diff flags - for example

git add .  vs git add -u 

git log  and git log --oneline

practice git revert  hard vs soft 

then collabotate 

branch out and merge the banches

handle conflicts

let person A push stuff 
person B changes locally and then pulling remote commits to handle more conflicts 

for advanced - git rebase +  cherry pick
